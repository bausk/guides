# Modern Development for the Web: Guides

Knowledge base on various gotchas and processes in different technology stacks.

YMMV: This repo is not production quality. It's basically a brain dump to pick out information for future talks, seminars, etc. Use at own discretion.

## Pre-Requisites

The list of stuff you need to install before going through with the guides has two parts: mandatory and opinionated. I try to maintain a uniform stack of tools on all projects and use Windows 10.

## Contents

[Starting and Deploying a Python Project](python/01_start_and_deployment.md)

[Consuming Data for Production in Python Apps](python/consuming_data.md)

[Using Kubernetes for Web Development](containers/k8s.md)
